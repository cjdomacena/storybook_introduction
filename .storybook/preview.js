/* parameters are typically used to control the behavior of Storybook's features and addons. In our case we're going to use them to configure how the actions (mocked callbacks) are handled.

actions allows us to create callbacks that appear in the actions panel of the Storybook UI when clicked. So when we build a pin button, weâ€™ll be able to determine in the test UI if a button click is successful.
